# Web-development

When i was just fifteen i created my first website by using wix.com
It was not at all good or useful but at that moment i disided that one day i will create a good professional website for me
the name of the website is "my daily diary" as the name indicates i used it as an daily blog, i upload a lot of my funny 
pictures in it and a lot of idiotic quotes and stories about my self.
link : https://abhilashstorm.wixsite.com/website This is the link to it, the reason i didn't delete it because i have some 
attach ments to it, after all it was my first ever website 
i learned HTML on my 10th grade, and it was based on the pure academic side, back then i was not interested in these kind of 
stufs i was interested  in pure science like physics chemistry and biology only.Also  my html knowleadge was extremly bad.
I HTML and CSS when i started to think about computer science, i think i was 16 or 17 at that time, but i still remember those
days like yesterday



What i learned :
        
       1. I have good knowleadge in HTML CSS and some moderate skill in javascript
       
       2. I use javascript in backend, and i have also some experience in javascript
          by building some games and automation scripts 
       
       3. The web-development also enhanced my designing skills and knoleadge and it
          helped me  in my UI/UX and Graphics designing area.
